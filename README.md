# random-python-projects

I uploaded some basic Python projects that I created while learning the fundamentals. These files have nothing in common with my other work
so I put them in a seperate repository. I am providing a short description of each file:

1) dice_roll.py. This file is a dice roller made in Tkinter.

2) guessing.py. This is a simple guessing game where the player has 5 tries to guess a randomly generated number between 1 and 10.

3) password.py. The project is a password generator that includes two capital and two small letters and also two numbers and two additional signs

4) temp_converter.py. As the name suggests, it's a temperature converter from Celsius to Fahrenheit. It has a GUI made in Tkinter.
